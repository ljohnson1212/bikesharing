	1. Males are taking far more rides than other users. 
	2. Rides on the Saturdays are taken the most between 10:00 and 7:00pm.
	3. Rides during the weekday are more common between 7:00am-9:00am and 5:00pm-7:00pm.

#CONCLUSION

	The analysis shows high activity of bike sharing in New York during the month of August 2019. The majority of the rides were in the Manhattan area, and mostly taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours (7-9am and 5-7pm). This shows me that the bike sharing service is used as an alternative transportation source for people working in the city.

Additional analysis that would increase the accuracy of data is comparing the analysis for different months to determine trends across the year and including weather data to find any correlation between the weather and the rides.
